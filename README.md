# ConvNeXt-Lightning
An implementation of the ConvNeXt architecture built on the PyTorch-Lightning API. The base model code (forward passes and architecture) are from the FAIR repo [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ConvNeXt).

This library allows easy loading of an untrained ConvNeXt model from the PyTorch Lightning API. Additionally, it provides an `ImageDataset(nn.Dataset)` module for image classification tasks.
